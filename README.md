# Bank Customer Analysis
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive Bank Customer Analysis by retrieving and showcasing various customer details such as the number of customers and balance amounts categorized by age, gender, region, job type, and joining date. 

Utilizing Power Query in Power BI I merged relevant data fields line first name and last name into name and age group ranges has created, and year extracted to from date column, and utilized DAX functions to create measures and conditional columns.

## The problem was outlined and addressed through several key analyses:
1) Balance and customer distribution by Age and Gender.
2) Customer count by Age, Gender, and Region.
3) Customer count by Region.
4) Balance distribution by Region.
5) Customer count by Job Type.
6) Balance distribution by Gender.
7) Total customers joined.
8) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including Max and Min Balance by Age, and Max Customers by Gender.
9) Count of customers by Age group and Region.

## Banking Performance Metrics:
1) **Key Performance Indicators** **(KPIs):** The metrics are calculated and displayed in card format to highlight the current scenario.

2) **Visualization:** The dashboard is visualized across two pages, utilizing page navigator buttons for easy redirection. Slicer filters for religion, job classification, and gender enhance visual insights. <br />
   **a) Line Charts:** One line chart depicts balance by age according to gender, with data label activation to display specific points. Another line chart showcases customer growth by month, including forecasted 
      future customer joinings. <br />
   **b) Column Charts:** Charts highlight the number of customers by age range and gender category, with data value counts provided. Another column chart illustrates customer distribution by age and region. <br />
   **c) Pie Charts and Donut Charts:** Multiple instances of these charts display balance by region, number of customers by region, and balance by gender in percentage value formats. <br />
   **d) Bar Charts:** Bar charts provide insights into customer count by region and customer count by job type, offering an overview of customer distribution across different regions and job classifications.

## Conclusion:
The Bank Customer Analysis project effectively utilized Power BI tools to derive key insights. Through the creation of KPIs and a visually engaging dashboard, we gained valuable understanding of customer demographics, behaviors, and financial trends. The visualizations provided clear representations of customer distribution by age, gender, region, and job type, facilitating informed decision-making. By forecasting future customer growth and highlighting performance metrics, this analysis offers actionable insights for optimizing banking strategies and enhancing customer experiences.
